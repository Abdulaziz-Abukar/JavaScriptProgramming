/*
ðŸ§  Coding Challenge: Merge Product Inventory
Prompt:

You are given two arrays of products:

One array contains the product details (name and price).

Another contains inventory counts for each product by name.

Write a function mergeInventory(products, inventory) that returns a new array where each object combines:

name (from the product list)

price (from the product list)

stock (from the inventory list)

If a product has no inventory info, assume stock = 0.

const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 999 },
  { name: "Phone", price: 599 },
  { name: "Tablet", price: 399 },
];

const inventory = [
  { name: "Laptop", stock: 5 },
  { name: "Phone", stock: 0 },
];
