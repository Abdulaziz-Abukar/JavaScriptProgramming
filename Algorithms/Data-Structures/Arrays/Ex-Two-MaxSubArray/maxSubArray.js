// AR-1) Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of consecutive elements (subarray).

// Kadene's Algorithm

/*
ðŸ§  Mental Model: Think Like You're Walking Through the Array
Start from the left, keep adding numbers as you go.

If the current sum drops below zero, reset â€” because a negative running sum is only going to drag down any future additions.

Keep track of the highest sum you've seen so far.

This is basically how Kadane's Algorithm works.
